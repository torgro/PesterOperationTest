# PesterOperationTest

## What is this
A collection of Pester test aimed at validating your infrastructure. Think of it like a place where you will find ready made templates for mission critical applications/features/services.

Initial thought is to create a folder for each vendor and then a folder for each app/thingy. Every test script will be published to the Powershell Gallery for easy access.

## Where does it come from
This is fully driven by the community and myself. If you want to supply code/tests, awesome. If you just want to use it, be my guest!

Pull requests are welcome as well as feedback.

## What is included

Currently there are tests for:

* Identity Manager (FIM/MIM)
* Active Directory

They are all work in progress, however they should work!

## Plans?

Yes, have plans for:

* Operation Manager
* Configuration Manager (MDT)
* SQL
* Azure Automation
* Azure in general
* HyperV
* ESX/VMWare
* Citrix
